# Pong DirectXTK

A DirectXTK 2D project created for my second term of my first year at The University of Huddersfield.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was created using the skills I had obtained from my first project. Put simple, it's a Pong game that has a main menu state, difficulty menu state and a play state.

Difficulty: As the difficulty level increases the middle puck becomes Bigger and faster.

Features:

- Two player.
- Game pad support.
- Score.
- Difficulty options.
- Menu.

What I Learnt from this Project:

- Creating a window.
- Handeling different game states.
- Rendering sprites (images) to the screen.
- 2D maths for solving collision. (AABB)
- Input methods with a controller. (Xbox 360 game pad)
